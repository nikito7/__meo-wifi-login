# meo-wifi-login

## Description:
Allows for an automated login through a MEO Wifi Premium hotspot.

## Usage
You may use `meo_wifi_login.py` file as regular script, running it via CLI...:

```
./meo_wifi_login -u <username> -p <password>
```

...or call the `meo_wifi_login` function through your script:
```
import meo_wifi_login

meo_wifi_login.meo_wifi_login('user','pass')
```

The script also looks for a `MEO_WIFI_USER` and `MEO_WIFI_PASSWORD` environment variable for the login information.

In case neither of these sources are available, it will prompt the user via console to fill them


## Dependencies
Beyond the standard Python libraries, you may need to install the following:

- `requests` *(optional, recommended)*
- `cryptography` *OR* `pyaes`

You can install them using pip. For example:

```
pip install requests cryptography
```

Several Linux distros also have packages for them. For example, in Debian 10 you can install them like this:

```
sudo apt-get install python-requests python-cryptography
```


### Notes
- `requests` is used to make HTTPS requests. A working (but probably less robust) urllib-based fallback is included.
- `cryptography` and `pyaes` are used to encrypt the password using AES.
- `cryptography` is preferred and more likely to already be installed or available in distributions.
- `pyaes` is a pure python alternative to `cryptography` and is good to have for when `cryptography` is harder to install. (e.g. Termux)
- The code has been ported to work on both Python 2 and 3. Make sure you install your dependencies for the version of Python you will be running the script with.

#### Python < 2.7.9
Python earlier than 2.7.9 has some restrictions on their `ssl` module that limits the configuration `urllib3` can apply.

If you have a `InsecurePlatformWarning` error, update Python to v2.7.9+ or install `requests` extra package set `security` with:


```
pip install requests[security]
```

This should install the following extra packages:

* pyOpenSSL>
* ndg-httpsclient
* pyasn1
